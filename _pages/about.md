Hi! I am currently a graduate student in the [Masters in Computational Social Science](https://macss.uchicago.edu) program at the University of Chicago. I am also working as a research assistant in the [Environmental Neuroscience Lab](https://voices.uchicago.edu/bermanlab/) for some time now and just started to work with the [Knowledge Lab](https://www.knowledgelab.org/) in summer 2020.

I received a B.A. degree in psychology and a B.S. degree in Brain Cognitive Science at Korea University, Republic of Korea. As an undergraduate, I conducted experiments using classical distractor tasks such as the Simon task and the Stroop task to investigate the cognitive control of humans. In the University of Chicago, I am working with psychological projects (such as visual attention, self-control, and depression), but I am also trying to get out of my comfort zone and exploring new areas (such as natural language processing, content analysis, and network analysis).

A very brief life trajectory of my life can be seen [here](/brief-life-trajectory/).
