Hi! I am currently a graduate student in the [Masters in Computational Social Science](https://macss.uchicago.edu) program at the University of Chicago. I am also working as a research assistant in the [Environmental Neuroscience Lab](https://voices.uchicago.edu/bermanlab/) (PI: Professor Marc G. Berman) and  the [Knowledge Lab](https://www.knowledgelab.org/) (PI: Professor James A. Evans).

I received a B.A. degree in psychology and a B.S. degree in Brain Cognitive Science at Korea University, Republic of Korea. As an undergraduate, I conducted experiments using classical distractor tasks such as the Simon task and the Stroop task to investigate the cognitive control of humans. At the University of Chicago, I am working mainly with projects involving virtual lab experiments, such as [BubbleView](https://bubbleview.namwkim.org/) or [Empirica](https://empirica.ly/). I am also working with projects using eye-tracking data and a large-scale academic article database.

A very brief life trajectory of my life can be seen [here](/brief-life-trajectory/).
