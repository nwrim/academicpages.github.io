Hi! I am currently a graduate student in the [Masters in Computational Social Science](https://macss.uchicago.edu) program in the University of Chicago. I am also a research assistant in the [Environmental Neuroscience Lab](https://voices.uchicago.edu/bermanlab/) and working with the [Knowledge Lab](https://www.knowledgelab.org/) for the summer 2020.

I received a B.A. degree in psychology and a B.S. degree in Brain Cognitive Science at Korea University, Republic of Korea. As an undergraduate, I conducted experiments using classical distractor tasks such as Simon task and Stroop tasks to investigate the cognitive control of humans. In the University of Chicago, I am working with psychological projects (such as visual attention, self-control and depression), but I am also trying to get out of my comport zone and exploring new areas (such as natural language processing, content analysis, and network analysis).

Very brief life trajectory of my life can be seen [here](/brief-life-trajectory/).
