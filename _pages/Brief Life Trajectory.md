I was very interested in biology during elementary school and middle school. I was a member of the science education academy for the gifted at a national university and won a prize in the Korean Biology Olympiad Middle School Division.

This interest in biology led me to a high school for the gifted named [Korean Minjok Leadership Academy](http://english.minjok.hs.kr/). I took the entrance exam as a Biology major and kept on taking Biology courses throughout my time at the school, eventually getting a full mark at the AP exam in Biology. However, the school offered a variety of courses in diverse disciplines ranging from ancient Chinese text reading to JAVA programming. I took a course in AP Psychology during my sophomore year. The course was centered around a lot of classical results in Psychology, and one of the experiments it talked about was the iconic memory and the Sperling partial report paradigm. Upon hearing about the experiment, I was awestruck by the fact that the experiment was so succinct but informative at the same time. I thought it was almost beautiful. One thing led to others after that, and I ended up in as a Psychology major at Korea University.

Of the vast subfields of Psychology, I gradually realized that I was interested in the more cognitive and biological division of Psychology. I started studying statistics on my own during my mandatory military service. (I was stationed in an office because I was an interpreter, which let me have more regular working hours) After being discharged from the military, I chose Brain Cognitive Science as my second major to take courses from the Department of Computer Science & Engineering and the Department of Biological Science. I also worked as an undergraduate RA in Professor Choâ€™s lab.

Upon graduation, I realized that my interests were closely related to computational modeling of human cognition, and I also wanted to learn how we can incorporate "Big data" (which I learned that this topic is increasingly attracted a lot of interests from various discipline) into psychological researches. This led me to join the Masters in Computational Social Science program at the University of Chicago, where I thought I could get deeper training in computational techniques and statistical modeling.
