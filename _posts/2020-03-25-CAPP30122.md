Project for CAPP30122 (Computer Science with Applications 2). Scraping restaurant information and linking them to other various data sources.

# Disclaimer

The restaurant information was scraped from [allmenus.com](https://allmenus.com). Although we are not uploading any scraped data, I will gladly remove this material from my website if there is any problem in regards to the copyright, etc.

# Brief Overview
In this project, we looked at menu items and prices from restaurants in Chicago. We linked the data to other data sources (i.e. crime rates, food safety inspection results, and area income) to 1) investigate whether these factors are correlated to food prices, and 2) evaluate if the inspection results are fair. We also visualized our findings with regard to locations in Chicago and food item prices. We constructed an OLS model for the aggregated dataset and found that 1) the features do not have a profound relationship with food prices 2) the food inspections are performed fairly and render unbiased results towards any of the restaurant features. 

# Data

The menu data was scraped from[allmenus.com](https://allmenus.com) and later categorized by cuisine. Both crime rates and inspection results were adapted from the [Chicago Data Portal](https://data.cityofchicago.org/). Census tract information was obtained from the [US Census Geocoder](https://geocoding.geo.census.gov/), with which median household income by tract was matched using the 2017 Chicago income data from [DATAUSA](https://datausa.io/). Record-linkage was performed by Jaro-Winkler distance to link restaurant data and inspection results. Crime occurrences within a vicinity of a restaurant were counted according to the coordinates.

# Results

By using the cuisine categories, inspection results, area income and crime rates, we intended to see if any of these features have any correlation with the pricing of these restaurants. However, after running an Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), several of the features were statistically significant yet none was meaningful for interpretation. On the other hand, we did notice that the food safety inspection results were reasonably fair, as restaurants receiving all levels of results had even distributions with regard to restaurant prices, safety in the neighborhood and area income. The area income, unsurprisingly, correlates with the prices really well. There is an obvious trend in prices that the higher the area income, the pricier the restaurant. 



For further study on this, we could include area population into consideration. As we can see in our findings, many of the area income,high crime rates and pricey restaurants are in the Loop area, where thereâ€™s is a higher population.
